I’m part of that special crew: devs who lift
Mobile and fullstack developer by day — gym rat by night.

I’m really into clean UI, smooth UX, and building diferrent apps.
Also, I love video games — not just playing, but the incredible experiences they deliver

Always learning. Always building. Always training.
